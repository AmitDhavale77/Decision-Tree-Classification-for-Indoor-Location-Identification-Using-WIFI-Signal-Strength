Introduction to Machine Learning
Decision tree coursework

This code will produce all of the outputs required to answer the questions in 
the coursework, including generating a visulisation of a decision tree. 

The Python version and library requirements are in requirements.txt #TODO

Running the script: 
In main.py set the file path to the data to build the model from then run main.py. 

In the terminal this will output: 
 - the the evaluation metrics of a demo unpruned tree and open a 
    visulisation of the tree (question 2)
 - the evaluation metrics for a demo pruned tree (question 3)
 - the average evaluation metrics for a 10 fold cross validation pruning a tree (question 3)
 - the average evaluation metrics for a nested 10 fold cross validation pruning trees (question 4)
