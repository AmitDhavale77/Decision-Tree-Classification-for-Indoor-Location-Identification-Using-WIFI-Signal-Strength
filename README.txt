Introduction to Machine Learning
Decision tree coursework

This code will produce all of the outputs required to answer the questions in 
the coursework, and optionally generating a visulisation of a decision tree. 

The Python version and library requirements are in requirements.txt

Running the script: 
In main.py set the file path to the data to build the model from then run main.py. 

In the terminal this will output: 
run_demo() 
   --> the the evaluation metrics of a demo unpruned and pruned tree and open a 
   visulisation of the trees (bonus question, default is commented out)
run_question_3() 
   --> the average evaluation metrics for a 10 fold cross validation on trees 
run_question_4()
   --> the average evaluation metrics for a nested 10 fold cross validation 
   pruning trees
